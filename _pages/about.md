Hi, I'm Alex 👋 

I burn for conversations and new ideas around technology. Be it in my work as a consultant and trainer, at conferences, or in meetups. In the past, I had the chance to work on several projects from a development and architecture point of view and experienced how important it is to bring architecture concepts “on the road”. Changing contexts and new environments interest me as they help me to think outside the box. I believe linking concepts and ideas leads to new and exciting insights. This is why I value the work as a consultant and trainer and the exchange with many interesting people.

I work for [embarc](embarc.de) and live in Munich, Germany.
